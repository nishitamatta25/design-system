Accordion components allow users to expand and collapse content sections, helping to organize information and reduce cognitive load.

## Accessibility

- Uses proper ARIA attributes (aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-hidden)
- Supports keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter/Space to toggle)
- Maintains focus management
- Includes smooth animations for state changes

## Usage Guidelines

- Use accordions to organize related information into digestible sections
- Keep accordion headers clear and descriptive
- Avoid nesting accordions for better usability
- Consider which sections should be expanded by default
